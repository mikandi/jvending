This package defines a Service Provider Interface for customizing and extending the capability matching engine
of the provisioning framework.
Each provisioning application is required to contain in its .war file a matcher configuration file called WEBINF/
matchers.xml. This file defines the algorithms used to match bundle requirements against device
capabilities. It associates each bundle requirement name with a class that implements the AttributeMatcher
interface
